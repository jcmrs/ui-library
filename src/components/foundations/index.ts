/**
 * Foundations
 *
 * Design system primitives - NOT UI components, but the building blocks
 * that components consume.
 *
 * Icons:
 * - Featured icons - Icon wrapper components for consistent styling
 * - Social icons - Brand icons for social platforms (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
 * - Payment icons - Payment method logos (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.)
 * - Logos - Product/brand logo components
 *
 * Design Tokens:
 * - Colors - Color palette, semantic colors
 * - Typography - Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
 * - Spacing - Spacing scale, layout values
 * - Breakpoints - Responsive breakpoint values
 * - Shadows - Box shadow definitions
 * - Borders - Border radius, widths
 *
 * Brand Assets:
 * - Brand colors
 * - Brand typography
 * - Brand guidelines
 *
 * Note: This is NOT a component category. These are primitives that
 * components import and use.
 *
 * @see UPSTREAM/react/components/foundations for reference implementation
