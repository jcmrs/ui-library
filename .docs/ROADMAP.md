# UI Library Project Roadmap

**Project:** AI-Native UI Component Library
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-23
**Status:** Phase 1 - Foundation

---

## Executive Summary

Building a production-ready UI component library that serves as a single source of truth for AI-assisted development, specifically designed to compensate for Claude Code's conceptual limitations in UI implementation.

**Core Problem:** Claude Code consistently fails at UI implementation despite having perfect examples, showing conceptual blindness to layouts, visual hierarchy, and component composition.

**Solution:** Rewrite industry-standard UntitledUI components with AI-native scaffolding, automation, and explicit inline documentation that requires zero conceptual understanding.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1.0: Automation Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

**Duration:** Completed 2025-01-24
**Status:** ✅ Complete with Core Features Implemented
**Goal:** Build git workflow automation and recovery infrastructure specifically for Claude Code

**Critical Insight:** This phase was added after multi-role analysis revealed that automation is not a feature but the foundational requirement. Without automated git workflow and session state management, Claude Code cannot maintain process discipline.

**Important Note:** Phase 1.0 was originally documented but NOT implemented during initial phases 1.0-1.3. Actual implementation completed 2025-01-24 after discovering the automation gap.

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items

1. **Phase 4 Validation Failure**

   - **Risk:** Approach doesn't work with Claude Code
   - **Mitigation:** Vertical slice with early validation
   - **Contingency:** Re-assess methodology, adjust scaffolding

2. **Component Composition Failures**

   - **Risk:** Components don't work together
   - **Mitigation:** Test compositions in Phase 3
   - **Contingency:** Add explicit composition validation

3. **Scope Creep**

   - **Risk:** Adding features indefinitely
   - **Mitigation:** Strict adherence to UntitledUI baseline
   - **Contingency:** Feature freeze after Phase 10

4. **Configuration Brittleness**
   - **Risk:** Dependency/config issues persist
   - **Mitigation:** Automated setup and validation
   - **Contingency:** Lock all dependency versions

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **Documentation Overhead**

   - **Risk:** Inline documentation slows development
   - **Mitigation:** Documentation templates and automation

2. **Test Maintenance**

   - **Risk:** Tests become outdated
   - **Mitigation:** Automated visual regression testing

3. **Performance Issues**
   - **Risk:** Large component library affects bundle size
   - **Mitigation:** Tree-shaking, code splitting
